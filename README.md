# GNU-Web-NewLook:
-----------------

"I made this site for showing some designing flaws that gnu.org implemented. They not just made their homepage unorganized! But also the way they design the homepage layout it's hard for the website visitor to go where the visitor wanted to go! So i designed this website for as a demo purpose only to attract the gnu.org developers attention so that they can make the user experience on their site better!" :-)

*Videos & Photos : Another thing i would like to mention which is they added videos to their website which is unnecessary to be honest! No one will visit your site only to watch a 1 hour or 2 hour long video. People mostly visit YouTube so rather then adding videos there if gnu community create a "Official GNU Channel" and add their videos there i think that will be good!
